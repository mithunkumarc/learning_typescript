as value undefined and null are same   

        console.log(undefined == null); // true

typeof null is object , undefined is undefined

        console.log(typeof undefined)// undefined
        console.log(typeof null); // object

comparing null and undefined with type : false

        console.log(undefined === null);// as type, they are different
